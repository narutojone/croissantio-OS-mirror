// This main CSS file contains all custom style specifications for GrowthBakery.com
// There's a styling file for every model that's
// being generated (page.scss, post.scss, ...). Model stylesheets are organized
// by page-type (index, show, standalone) whilst the css is ordered by location in the DOM. All
// properties are sorted using CSSComb. Ex;

// models/posts.css.scss
// - index-page
// {DOM ordered & property sorted css}
// - show-page
// {DOM ordered & property sorted css}

// Currently this website relies heavily (mostly) on vendor stylesheets in the vendor directory.
// Admin theme is from; https://colorlib.com/polygon/gentelella/general_elements.html
// User theme is from: http://trystack.mediumra.re/
// Blog show also has a stylesheet called articles.css.scss in /models
