Referral program

Context (see example --> http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/21/harrys-prelaunchr-email) :

Creating a referral program for a 72hours contest starting wednesday at 10am Paris Time.

2 tickets to win & 1 winner.
2 tickets --> http://www.growthhackingconference.com & http://www.blendwebmix.com
Total value = 1015 euros

1 person will win big (1015 euros in tickets value) but we want people to share the contest to their friends. So to get more chance to win the tickets you can share the contest and for each people who join from you, you got one more seat in the contest pool.
